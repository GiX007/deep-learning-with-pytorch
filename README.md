# Deep Learning with PyTorch ðŸ”¥

This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning **deep learning with PyTorch**, designed to cover both fundamentals and advanced techniques.  

It is mainly based on my curated collection of notebooks in **`learn-pytorch-with-X`**, which explores PyTorch basics, workflows, computer vision, custom datasets, transfer learning, experiment tracking, and deployment.  

Additionally, it is inspired by the book *Deep Learning with PyTorch* by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann.  
For the official code examples from the book, see the authorsâ€™ repository: [dlwpt-code](https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code).
